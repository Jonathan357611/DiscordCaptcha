# DiscordCaptcha
## Introduction
A discord bot which creates Captcha to verify users easily!

The Captchas will look something like this:

## Invite
~~If you dont want to host the bot yourself (Which would give you even more configurability!), you can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=984819036024078406&permissions=268436548&scope=bot) to your server!~~

**NOT ONLINE YET, I'LL DO MY BEST!**

## Usage
The bot is very configurable, you can set an own Captcha length, Max tries-before-ban, Custom messages and even more when self hosting this bot, as own expiration delays or longer Captchas!

    Set captcha length (Between 1-15 in the bot hosted by me)

- v!correct-casing \<y|n>

    If a user has to use the correct casing used in the Captcha
